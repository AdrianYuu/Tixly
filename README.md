- **Counterfeit Tickets**: Consumers are often tricked into buying fake tickets, leading to financial losses and missed events.
- **Excessive Fees**: Traditional platforms often impose high fees, making tickets more expensive.
- **Unfair Accessibility**: Many ticketing systems are vulnerable to bot attacks, giving bots an unfair advantage over genuine fans.
